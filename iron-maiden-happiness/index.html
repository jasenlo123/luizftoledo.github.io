                <br>
            <p> Metalheads are known for angry and loud songs. </p>
            <br>
            <p>It's just a stereotype, of course, as the gender can range 
                from very soft songs such as ballads like 
                Fade to Black (Metallica) to the extreme speed and 
                harsh vocals like those in Dead by Dawn (Deicide). 
                <p>But what can we say about the average metal band?</p>
<br>
                <p>Well, I didn't find a way to collect every metal band 
                in the world and create a database.
                 I'm studying data journalism, but I'm still 
                 just a journalist who knows…a little bit of data. A
                 nd likes metal.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So I decided to analyze the most famous metal band ever 
                    and ask this stupid, but interesting question 
                    (at least for me): how happy and cheerful can an 
                    Iron Maiden concert be? How happy are their songs, 
                    in general? Will they follow the stereotype 
                    of the gender they kind of lead?</p>
                <br>
                <p>More than that. Could you dance in an Iron Maiden concert?
                (and I'm not talking about the mega funk version of 'The Trooper')</p>

                <br>
                
                <p> This project will try to answer that by using Spotify API, 
                    based on the valence and other variables. 
                    According to Spotify documentation, 
                    valence is a "measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical 
                    positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence 
                    sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while 
                    tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."</p>

                <br>
                
            <p>I have removed duplicates and kept the most popular 
                for each song. My final list has 189 tracks, which includes 
                intros and some extra stuff. </p>
                <br>
               <p> Be aware: this is not exact science.
                    It's just a simple data analysis for the Master 
                    Science in Data Journalism at Columbia Journalism
                     School. It's not intended to offend anyone. 
                     I'm actually a huge fan of the band and 
                     play in a metal band of my own. :)</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Fear of the…happiness?</h2>
                
                <p>Well, in order to offer happy songs in a concert, 
                    a band must have written happy songs. 
                    How does Spotify classify Iron Maiden's 
                    discography based on happiness?</p>

                    <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.6.2/css/bulma.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
                    <img alt="Here is a description of the chart" src='valence_histogram.png'>
                
               <p>Not much. This is how the discography is distributed. 
                   The mean valence for all the songs is 0.36 out of 1. 
                   Iron Maiden is not happy, at least
                    not on average (whatever that means…)</p>
                <p>It doesn't mean that the band can't produce songs 
                that would make Eddie smile. Ironically, the happiest
                 Iron Maiden song is Wratchild. 
                 
                 <br>

                 <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1SpuDZ7y1W4vaCzHeLvsf7?utm_source=generator" width="250" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

                 <br>

                 <p>It tells the story about a young man who is 
                 searching for his unknown father. Does it look sad? 
                 Well, listen to the chorus and then compare it to other songs. </p>
                
                <p><i>'Cause I'm a wrathchild</p>
           <p>Well I'm a wrathchild</p>
               <p> Yeah, I'm a wrathchild</p>
                <p>I'm coming to get you ooh, yeah, yeah'</p></i>
                
                
                
            <p>On the bottom there's an intro track, 
                Churchill's Speech, and Lord of Light, 
                from A Matter of Life and Death album.<p>
                
                <p>At this point, it is important to mention that 
                    lyrics are not considered in Spotify's measure 
                    of valence. At least not according to the documentation.</p>

                <p>Now let's take a look at how a full concert
                     would look in terms of happiness. 
                     We based our chart on an "average setlist" 
                     containing the most common song sequence for 
                     their shows in 2019.</p>
                
                
                <iframe title="Iron Maiden's &quot;average&quot; setlist and happiness levels" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-Y0BmU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Y0BmU/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="388"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                </script>
                
                
                
                <h2> The question is: can you actually dance Maiden songs?</h2>

                <p>There's one particular song that would go great at a party,
                     but not for shows. 'The Apparition' seems to be very 
                     suitable to dance, though you probably will never 
                     see them performing it live as they never played 
                     it during a concert. Some fans even argue that this 
                     is "easily their worst song".</p>

                     <iframe title="If you wanna dance Maiden, The Apparition is your choice" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-E5WSq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/E5WSq/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="679"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                     </script>
                
                
                
                <p>So why are there so many sad songs? 
                    Do people enjoy it? For now, let's just compare 
                    it with popularity.</p>

                    <iframe title="Happiness x popularity in Iron Maiden songs" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-sF38P" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sF38P/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                    </script>
                
                
           <p>Maybe we should just ask Bruce Dickinson. Other factors might explain
                how popular a song is, but happiness is 
                definitely not one of them. Most popular songs 
                like The Trooper and Fear of the Dark go to 
                opposite places in the chart and there is no 
                strong correlation between these two variables.
                
                <br>>
                
                <p>But there's one thing we can say for sure. 
                    The band definitely transmits a lot 
                    of energy in their songs. 
                    Most tracks are on the top of Spotify's "energy" bar 
                    (meaning "fast, loud and noisy") equal or higher 
                    than 0.8, in a scale that goes from 0 to 1. </p>

                <br>
                
                <p>One last thought: it seems that the band's 
                    songs are getting sadder as the years go by. 
                    Nothing beats the positive energy of the 80s 
                    and early 90s.</p>
