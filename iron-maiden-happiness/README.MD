### How happy can Iron Maiden songs be? ### 

I have used the Spotify API to download the data. You can read the full code here. Happiness was measured by the song "valence", which is a value from 0 to 1 that considers how positive a song is, according to Spotify. Only studio albums were considered. Live albums and single were removed from the analysis.</p>
