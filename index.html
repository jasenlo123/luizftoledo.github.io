          Data and investigative journalism
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          I am a journalist using investigative and data techniques to impact society positively. 
          <p>I am currently pursuing a master's degree in data journalism at Columbia University 
          after being awarded a full scholarship due to professional achievements in my home country, Brazil.
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>I can write both in Portuguese and English, cover breaking news under tight deadlines, 
            collaborate with or coordinate national or cross-border journalistic projects, 
            analyze huge databases using programming languages (Python, SQL), automate journalistic tasks, 
            get documents using different techniques, from sourcing to Freedom of Information requests 
            and do academic research.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have also coordinated and contributed to multiple projects that improve government transparency. I co-founded Fiquem Sabendo, a Brazilian NGO that finds, organizes and releases relevant public data for free. Our work and expertise is being used as a source of data by every major news outlet in Brazil, both at local, national and international levels. I am also one of the Brazilian Association for Investigative Journalism (Abraji) directors and develop different projects there to help journalists get and use public data.</p>
