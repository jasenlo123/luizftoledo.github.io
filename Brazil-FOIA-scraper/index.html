    <h1>Scraping Brazil's Freedom of Informaction Act (FOIA) requests</h1>
    <p>These scrapers were built in Python/Selenium. They save all FOIA requests (Freedom of Information Act or Lei de Acesso à Informação in Portuguese) sent by Brazilian citizens in a spreadsheet based on a specific keyword. </p>
    <p>The first scraper, "Raspador de decisões da CGU com o termo LGPD no texto.ipynb", creates a spreadsheet containing all those FOIA requests that were denied by the federal government because of alleged sensitive/personal information. The second scraper, "pedidos_sobre_Bolsonaro_no_FALABR.ipynb", creates a spreadsheet containing all FOIA requests and answers for those requests in the last 30 days (it is possible to change the time) for a specific keyword.</p>
