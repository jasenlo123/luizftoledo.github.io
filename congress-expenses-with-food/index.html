            <p>Brazilian congresspeople are famous for spending money on <a href="https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/politica-brasil/sem-limite-de-gastos-congresso-reembolsa-despesas-de-parlamentares-com-ostras-e-camarao-trufado">fancy</a> food and restaurants. </p>

<p>They have the right to use a certain amount of public funds every year for mandate expenses, including food. Congress 
rules <a href="https://www2.camara.leg.br/legin/int/atomes/2009/atodamesa-43-21-maio-2009-588364-norma-cd-mesa.html">declare</a> that this money, known as “cota parlamentar”, should be used to pay for congresspeople’s own meals.</p>

<p>But many more people might be filling their bellies with those funds.</p>

<p>An analysis made using open data shows that dozens of meals have been paid 
    by congresspeople who took office in 2019 on the same day and receipt. 
    Some representatives have spent over R$ 3,000 in just one meal (US$ 565) with over 30 plates.
The rules state that the receipts should be presented by the politician in order to get reimbursed.  </p>

<p> Public data can show how much money was spent and the the place where the money was spent, but it doesn't always reveal what was the food neither who were with them. The Congress rules don’t 
require representatives to justify these expenses. </p>

<p> The data source can be found <a href="https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br/swagger/api.html#staticfile">here</a>. Check the code on <a href="https://github.com/luizftoledo/luizftoledo.github.io/tree/main/congress-expenses-with-food">Github.</a><p>

<p><strong>Summarizing the expenses</strong></p>

<p>First let's take a look on how much federal deputies spent in 2019, 2020 and 2021,
 after there were elected, individually. This is the sum of all their receipts. 
I chose to analyze the data from different years together because 2020 and 2021
 were very atypical years due to 
 the pandemic and 
 the <a href="https://www.poder360.com.br/congresso/camara-so-volta-ao-trabalho-presencial-em-marco-apos-carnaval/">home office policy</a> 
 in the Congress. Less money was spent in food, transportation, etc.</p>

 </script>

<p>Congressman Bibo Nunes was the one who spent the most with food, 
    but it doesn't mean his meals were more expensive.
    Let's check the average price per receipt.</p>

    </script>

<p>Here's another way to visualize it. Each point is a receipt. Put the mouse over it to see who presented that receipt.</p>

</p>
<p>Now let's check individual receipts and what it contains. Federal deputies 
    Alexandre Frota and Rubens Bueno lead on the list. 
Data shows that there were several meals paid in the same document. 
There's also some hotel expenses on this list, which could be a categorization mistake from the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

If you want to look for a specific politician instead, use this tool below to search for names and receipts.
